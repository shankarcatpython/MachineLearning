Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms 
and statistical models to enable computer systems to learn from data, 
without being explicitly programmed. The goal of machine learning is to develop algorithms 
that can automatically learn patterns and insights from data, 
and use these insights to make predictions or decisions.

In machine learning, a computer system is trained on a set of data to identify patterns and 
relationships in that data. This training process involves feeding large amounts of data into 
a model and adjusting the model's parameters until it can accurately predict outcomes 
or classify new data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions or 
decisions based on new input data.

Machine learning has applications in a wide range of fields, including computer vision, 
natural language processing, speech recognition, fraud detection, recommender systems, 
and more...
