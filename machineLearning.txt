Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms 
and statistical models to enable computer systems to learn from data, 
without being explicitly programmed. The goal of machine learning is to develop algorithms 
that can automatically learn patterns and insights from data, 
and use these insights to make predictions or decisions.

In machine learning, a computer system is trained on a set of data to identify patterns and 
relationships in that data. This training process involves feeding large amounts of data into 
a model and adjusting the model's parameters until it can accurately predict outcomes 
or classify new data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions or 
decisions based on new input data.

Machine learning has applications in a wide range of fields, including computer vision, 
natural language processing, speech recognition, fraud detection, recommender systems, 
and more...

LinearRegression:

Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for 
predicting a target variable (also known as the dependent variable) based on 
one or more predictor variables (also known as independent variables or features). 

The basic idea behind linear regression is to fit a linear equation to observed 
data points by minimizing the difference between the observed values 
and the values predicted by the equation. 

The goal is to find the line of best fit, 
which can be used to make predictions for new data points. 

The equation of the line is represented as Y = b0 + b1 * X1 + b2 * X2 + ... + bn * Xn, 
where Y is the dependent variable, X1, X2, ... Xn are the predictor variables, 
b0 is the intercept or , and b1, b2, ... bn are the coefficients of the equation. 

Linear regression can be used for simple linear regression 
(when there is only one predictor variable) 
or multiple linear regression (when there are two or more predictor variables).
